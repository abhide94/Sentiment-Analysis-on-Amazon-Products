# Sentiment-Analysis-on-Amazon-Products

In this project we carry out Sentimental Analysis on Amazon's Books Dataset based on reviews on a million books and predict whether this review is 'Positive', 'Neutral', 'Negative'. Apart from reviews we have also predicted their individual ratings. We have four different approaches to our project.

Product reviews are becoming more important with the evolution of traditional brick and mortar retail stores to online shopping. Consumers are posting reviews directly on product pages in real time. With the vast amount of consumer reviews, this creates an opportunity to see how the market reacts to a specific product. We will be attempting to see if we can predict the sentiment of a product review using machine learning tools, particularly the Support Vector Machine.

This project was completed using Jupyter Notebook and Python with Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib and Scikit-Learn.
